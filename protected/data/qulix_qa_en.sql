An integrator will understand that there''s a kind of extreme there. Thanks to the teamwork of the software architects, business analysts and developers we have fulfilled the customer''s ideas: designed an optimal architecture of the system and its components, unified the exchange protocols, provided a cross platform environment for the system operation, added an asynchronous connection with mobile devices.

A leader is someone who causes us to focus not on the obstacles but on how to get things done especially in business domain. This is someone who has sheer force in his deeds so strategic planning helps to go with the times. A leadership is a visionary who has the ability to articulate goals, business objectives, and aspirations. A leader must also have an appreciation of the differences in people - not only in gender or race, but in views or philosophy. This is especially important in IT nowadays as we know that IT domain is rapidly growing.</p>\r\n<p><span class=\"Bold\">VLE:</span> And who is a successful leader?<br /> <span class=\"Bold\">AAR:</span> A successful leader must have a sense of who the people in his company are and where they come from.

Creating a vision and a direction is more important than ever. What are the most important aspects in Business development?<br /> <span class=\"Bold\">AAR:</span> Well, first of all this is Business Plan Design and Development. A current and well-designed formal business plan is the foundation of any successful business. Sometime sit is not easy to convey excellent ideas into a fully developed business plan. It then becomes a living document that requires constant monitoring and customization to meet existing and emerging business opportunities. Then Strategic and Financial goal alignment follows. It is important to identify important ''Strategic Driver'' and critical success factors. Then Initiation and Formulation of Strategic Business partnerships go. These are relationships that leverage your visibility, capability, your market presence. It grows your business at a much faster pace.</p>\r\n<p><span class=\"Bold\">VLE:</span> Are there any specific approaches in Qulix Systems to running a business?<br /> <span class=\"Bold\">AAR:</span> The aim of Business development department of Qulix Systems is to make profitable and well-informed decisions about the IT market and launching of our new projects.

But the reverse of the medal is the following- knowledge gained there gives a real base which helps a young specialist to find himself in lots of areas which are not related to radioelectronics. In IT domain I came in after some time of working at Nokia service center and some trading companies - which is even more distant from QA then you can imagine. It was 5 years ago. There was no profound knowledge and practice of computer work in me at those days so lots of my time was spent on getting to know computer administration peculiarities except managing the main task of gaining QA tester proficiency. The start of my QA tester position was really quick. First I had a training practice during one day on Saturday after which I was provided with heaps of documentation and manuals to consult with. Second, on Monday I was already testing a system for one of our Belarusian clients. It was really exciting and challenging. QA profession is really exciting and you should not trust those who claim the opposite. My second project in IT domain was a real university of life. It was a project with foreign customers which was conducted strictly on RUP (Rational Unified Process) by an excellent management staff. Benefits of my participation in that project were obvious.

Moreover, such a person is always a creative man who is able to lay out complicated tasks in a plain manner skillfully, thinks logically and sequentially.</p>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><span class=\"Bold\">VLE:</span> Is there is something not worthy paying attention in QA?<br /> <span class=\"Bold\">AZH:</span> Every detail has to be taken into account in QA of a system''s run. This is what determines a qualified tester. The core thing here is not to worry much about ''friendly'' attacks of your developers reckoning that a tester is a project enemy who delays projects termination. A good thing here is that such developers are few today though everybody knows counteraction phenomenon. Developers work for creation, QA testers - for breaking and finding bugs in their work. That is understandable but we are a good team though.</p>\r\n<p><span class=\"Bold\">VLE:</span> How did you personally stick to Quality Assurance?<br /> <span class=\"Bold\">AZH:</span> I was lucky to get to Qulix Systems when formalization of processes and the whole work in the company was at its beginning. The world of QA was also changing constantly, new methodologies were appearing and I was up to that with a real will. The work was complex and challenging. But when your brand-new ideas find positive feedback of colleagues and customers you are proud of yourself and feel really influential.</p>\r\n<p><span class=\"Bold\">VLE:</span> Does every software project need testers?<br /> <span class=\"Bold\">AZH:</span> If customers are interested in a successful realization of a project than I would strongly recommend presence of good testers. Bugs are a common place in a development process no matter what professional level programmers possess. The point here is only in quantity of bugs. Talking about statistics I may say that 90 % of all bugs are usually fixed by developers while code compiling process and launching a product. 10 % of them just can''t be found because of substandard situations in program'' run which can not be taken into account by developers. In some cases developers do not lift a hand in launching a written code to make sure that everything is ok. So testers are exactly what any development process always needs to secure the process and a company'' s name.</p>\r\n<p><span class=\"Bold\">VLE:</span> What kinds of testing should be considered on a project?<br /> <span class=\"Bold\">AZH:</span> There is no a well-defined answer here. The number of tests needed is a unique thing to define and primarily depends on a project itself, its requirements, terms and conditions of programming, the way future system will be running. But there are some common recommendations here. Testing process has to be started at the period of a project'' initiation. Technical and functional specifications should be checked. The beginning of a project is an important period that must not be omitted. All mistakes at that period can smoothly ruin further successful project development and system''s performance. Usually it saves time and money. Such efforts at the beginning reduce project''s costs.</p>\r\n<p><span class=\"Bold\">VLE:</span> What are common problems in the software development process?<br /> <span class=\"Bold\">AZH:</span> Well, it''s not easy to determine at once the most common ones. There are lots of them but a competent manager saves situation. Here are some pitfalls that usually occur: Ignorant project manager - the most crucial thing on a project. Problems with working hours and efforts assessment, goals allocation and performance audit, processes design easily supplement. Badly formulated system''s requirements, their incomprehensibility, incompleteness, ambiguity. Incorrectly chosen technologies for project development. Global changes in a project in the middle of the development process - system''s architecture and database structure alteration which drags out project terms and increases expenses.</p>\r\n<p><span class=\"Bold\">VLE:</span> What is software ''quality''?<br /> <span class=\"Bold\">AZH:</span> As for me this is a hookup of functional and technical system''s requirements fitness with final realization. Moreover a qualitative project is the one with great functional procurement and neither testers nor final users were able to find bugs and defaults.</p>\r\n<p><span class=\"Bold\">VLE:</span> How can it be known when to stop testing?<br /> <span class=\"Bold\">AZH:</span> Many modern software applications are so complex, and run in such an interdependent environment, that complete testing can never be done. Common factors in deciding when to stop are:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Deadlines of a project;</li>\r\n<li>Test cases completed with certain percentage passed;</li>\r\n<li>Coverage of code/functionality/requirements reaches a specified point;</li>\r\n<li>Bug rate falls below a certain level;</li>\r\n<li>Beta or alpha testing period ends;</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><span class=\"Bold\">VLE:</span> Who is a good QA tester?<br /> <span class=\"Bold\">AZH:</span> This is not only a person with proper education (mathematics, informatics) with logical thinking and attention to details, but also a person who leaves and breathes for QA. In that case that job can be a dream career.</p>\r\n<p><span class=\"Bold\">VLE:</span> What Qulix Systems does to provide qualified and efficient QA performance?<br /> <span class=\"Bold\">AZH:</span> Qulix Systems always thinks about our testers'' professional level fitness on a global IT market. We cherish every newcomer and help in software development proficiency reach. First of all I may say that we are very thorough in our employees'' recruitment. This is a primary stage when those with not a high proficiency level are sifting out. Also we educate them. Seminars and trainings are conducted. Then we make a newbie a stand-by tester or developer with his own concrete tasks. That gives an opportunity to dive into the process at once. Results of his work can be easily seen and necessary hints and recommendations can be provided which reduces time spent and increases speed of their learning. We use the practices of special educational materials preparation by qualified testers. All of these we discuss during our seminars where the best new working practices are deciding to be used. One of the most determining facts which help our testers to gain experience is a challenging work with diverse project tasks. We try to make sure that every single tester knows how to be a functional tester, test-designer, automation tests developer, analyst and technical writer. One - year project of individual development and growth preparation is another useful thing we practice in Qulix Systems. When all of that is discussed a manager helps to intensify and streamline a newcomer''s professional growth.</p>\r\n<p><span class=\"Bold\">VLE:</span> Thank you!</p>\r\n<p>AZH - Alexander Zhendinsky is Qulix Systems Test Team Manager, has 5 years experience in QA field, wide experience in development of test documentation - test plans, test suites, test cases, test surveys, test scenarios, etc; excellent knowledge of test methodologies, test and development processes, interaction and communication processes building between customers and test team.</p>\r\n<p>VLE - Vera Leonik, Qulix Systems eMarketing Specialist</p>\";}'),

Of course we usually work very closely with our clients trying to establish the most appropriate processes in communication, requirements management and change management, acceptance procedures and so on. Nevertheless we think that the culture of business relations in outsourcing sphere is quite specific and it would be good to have certain knowledge before going into some collaboration and thus learning practical aspects in due course. We consider our current experience with University of Hamburg to be quite positive. Young people are potential future managers and some of them could be involved into outsourcing operations. The information we provided to them will definitely be useful and hopefully will contribute to the general success of their companies. But the success here is mutual, so Qulix will also benefit from efficient communication processes with its German customers in long term.</p>\r\n<p>For the moment, we are just starting our operations in Germany and probably will establish our office here somewhere in mid of 2008.

We are very satisfied with this collaboration with University of Hamburg and probably we will jointly extend it in the nearest future.

That test automation offers a whole range of definite advantages when implemented into a well-balanced and fine-tuned process of software development is beyond question.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>You are interested in test automation for your projects but there are no specialists of the required qualification in your company?</li>\r\n<li>How painful might the implementation of test automation be in terms of your project or department?</li>\r\n<li>What kind of efficiency and advantages may be expected of test automation?</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>These and lots of other questions flash across the mind of those Qulix QA customers who intend to adopt test automation into their projects. Prior to thinking about the introduction of test automation you should check if the QA process in your projects is fine-tuned, documented and runs like a clock. Remember that adoption of test automation is no tribute to fashion but a task aimed at transmitting your project quality assurance to a principally new level. The goal is to improve the efficiency of project testing, not to get one more headache.</p>\r\n<p>The second step is hiring specialists to quickly and professionally help you start the process of test automation. Of course, you can try implementing the practice using your own effort, but without experienced specialists this process is likely to take a lot of time, go by trial and error, exceed the planned budget, and finally put you off employing any automated testing practices.</p>\r\n<p>Innovative methods of test automation offer the possibility to minimize consulting services while reaping more benefit from cooperation with consulting firms and successfully developing this practice in your company.</p>\r\n<p>In case of from scratch test automation implementation we normally recommend that a framework based on a keyword-driven approach principle should be developed along with running a training course thus enabling your specialists to update the framework and expand automated test coverage. For the present moment KeyWord Driven frameworks offer the most technologically advanced solution as to the price/quality/efficiency correlation.</p>\r\n<p>The advantages of such a framework include:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Maximum reuse of code: substantially, there is a single script that manages all implementation process;</li>\r\n<li>The technology does not exclude Data Driven methods which gives it all advantages of the Data Driven approach;</li>\r\n<li>All actions are compiled in Excel data tables or may be presented in any other format specified by the customer;</li>\r\n<li>All user interface objects are stored in external files;</li>\r\n<li>Additional description of all test cases and test suites is provided in external files (normally in Excel format) for easy start-up options management;</li>\r\n<li>The framework allows maximum flexibility: it is easy to add, delete, and edit existing test cases and test suites which requires no extra skills other than framework operation;</li>\r\n<li>Adding new actions as well as changing the existing ones requires no complex operations &ndash; it&rsquo;s enough to write a new function thus smoothly and painlessly extending the framework;</li>\r\n<li>When switching to a different test automation tool minimum of code is subject to revision, test cases remain as they are.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>This is a cure-all solution for a number of test departments, for the requirements for specialist qualification get considerably lower, once the development of framework and a training course in framework operation have taken place &ndash; it is sufficient to have MS Excel skills.</p>\r\n<h2>How to adopt test automation</h2>\r\n<p>A rule of thumb states that the process should go through the following phases:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Analysing a set of tasks and software development technologies employed by the customer. The analysis provides means for selection of the best test automation tool (paid or free). The scheduled tasks make the backbone for the implementation plan, essential process documentation, and any adjustments to the training course syllabus, whereas practice drills depend on the selected test automation tool.</li>\r\n<li>The focal point of the second phase is the course named Introduction into Automated Software Testing. The course covers all crucial theoretical points as to the process, structure and methods of test automation. Course participants pick up skills in tool management, do practical tasks in functional test script development, learn to correctly create test cases and incorporate them into automated test suites, design core libraries for framework creation and script running.</li>\r\n<li>The concluding phase is all about putting the acquired knowledge into practice. This is the time when trainees supervised by the tutors plan the degree of automated test coverage, develop the framework, perform automation of the stated set of system functions, activate mechanisms of script run and result collection inside of a working project.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>Once the practice of test automation has been implemented into the manufacturing process the customer should get:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>An infrastructure that is completely ready for further development of test automation inside of a project;</li>\r\n<li>Functional script package covering the stated set of functions with the specified test thoroughness;</li>\r\n<li>Trained specialists capable of independent further development of test automation inside of a given project;</li>\r\n<li>Schedule of test automation activities;</li>\r\n<li>Description of the framework and scripts for the software solution in whose development process test automation was implemented.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>An estimated time frame for the project:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Implementation task analysis: ~ 1 - 2 weeks;</li>\r\n<li>Training (depending on the syllabus): ~ 4 &ndash; 10 business days;</li>\r\n<li>Implementation into an active project (depending on the scheduled scope of work): ~ 3 weeks &ndash; 1,5 weeks.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>With Qulix QA you will get even more benefits, such as:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Transparent and easy-to-understand results reporting and logging system; All start-up logs can be stored in one folder; it is possible to create a results view engine listing results according to the application version number;</li>\r\n<li>Easy script start-up: it takes only one BAT file to run a batch (batches);</li>\r\n<li>Easy sitemap maintenance to ensure minimum cost of update after GUI has been changed;</li>\r\n<li>Complete document package on the created test automation system;</li>\r\n<li>Easy creation of new test cases and test suites will ensure minimum cost of test coverage extension and require no additional skills.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>Company Profile</h2>\r\n<p>Qulix QA (<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.qa.qulix.com\">www.qa.qulix.com</a>) specialises in providing flexible, adaptable and speedy services in independent software testing as well as consulting about QA activities for IT projects.

While reading I tried to make notes and conclusions that are already known to many and are used as a reminder about the core principles stated by the author.</p>\r\n<p>I am pleased to offer these notes to you but I need to emphasise that, though being a poor substitute for the actual reading of the book, they can be of some use if you want to refresh your knowledge.</p>\r\n<p>So, here we go ...</p>\r\n<h2>Four Basic Rules of Management</h2>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Find the right people;</li>\r\n<li>Set them to work that they can do best;</li>\r\n<li>Remember about motivation issues;</li>\r\n<li>Put together a good team and encourage them to keep going in the same vein.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>The rest is administrative nonsense.</p>\r\n<h2>Security and Change</h2>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>If a person doesn&rsquo;t feel safe he or she will be reluctant to change;</li>\r\n<li>A manager needs changes to work successfully (surely, change is necessary in any other activity);</li>\r\n<li>Uncertainty provokes risk-avoiding behaviour;</li>\r\n<li>A person who avoids risks misses a zillion of opportunities and benefits that could have caused his or her life to change;</li>\r\n<li>It is nice and easy to bully a person with direct threats but there is an option of giving them to understand that they may be treated with callousness and cruelty exerting the same effect.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h2>Negative Motivation</h2>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Threats provide the most unsuitable type of motivation if it is personal efficiency of your employees that you are hunting for.</li>\r\n<li>Whatever threats you make, the task will remain unaccomplished if you had allowed too little time for it from the very start.</li>\r\n<li>More than that, you will have to keep your promises in case people fail.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h2>Parts of the Body Needed for Project Management</h2>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Leadership skills require heart, gut, soul and nose:</li>\r\n<li>That&rsquo;s why one should:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>lead from the heart;</li>\r\n<li>trust to their gut;</li>\r\n<li>build soul into the team and into the project;</li>\r\n<li>have a nose for bullshit.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h2>Commander in Chief on the Battlefield as a Metaphor for Project Management</h2>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>The commander in chief&rsquo;s work has already been done before the battle begins.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h2>Job Interview and Employment</h2>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>In order to recruit a good employee a manager will need all their skills &ndash; heart, soul, nose, and gut (the latter to a greater extent).</li>\r\n<li>Don&rsquo;t try to employ staff single-handedly &ndash; it is much wiser to use intuition of two managers.</li>\r\n<li>Ask new team members to take on the tasks similar to those they had already succeeded in before and to think of their great ambition and professional advancement in terms of a project that will follow.</li>\r\n<li>Ask for a tip-off &ndash; your team members will most certainly be able to advise you on whom else to recruit.</li>\r\n<li>Listen more, speak less.</li>\r\n<li>All this is likely to work even better if you slightly stack the deck.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h2>Productivity Improvement</h2>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>There are no short-term measures that result in a rapid efficiency improvement.</li>\r\n<li>Productivity improvement is a consequence of a long lasting effort.</li>\r\n<li>Any efficiency improvement methods that promise an immediate effect are essentially snake oil.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h2>Risk Management</h2>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Manage projects by managing their risks.</li>\r\n<li>Make a list of risks for each project.</li>\r\n<li>Determine those risks that cause a project to fail rather than final risks alone.</li>\r\n<li>Estimate the probability and cost of each risk.</li>\r\n<li>For each risk calculate an index, i.e. evidence indicating that the risk is turning into a problem.</li>\r\n<li>Put someone in charge of risk management one person who is not expected to maintain a Can-Do attitude.</li>\r\n<li>Establish available (perhaps anonymous) channels of communication for breaking bad news up the hierarchy.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h2>Playing Defence</h2>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Cut your losses.</li>\r\n<li>You can improve your overall performance more by containing your failures than by optimising your success.</li>\r\n<li>Be aggressive about cancelling failed efforts early.</li>\r\n<li>Don&rsquo;t take chances on team building if you don&rsquo;t have to: seek out and use pre-formed teams.</li>\r\n<li>Keep good teams together (when they are willing) once the project is over to help your successors avoid problems of slow-building or non-building teams.</li>\r\n<li>Think of a formed team &ndash; ready and willing to take on a new effort &ndash; as one of the project deliverables.</li>\r\n<li>A day lost at the beginning of a project hurts just as much as a day lost at the end.</li>\r\n<li>There are one hundred and one ways to lose a day and none to bring one back.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h2>Modelling and Simulation of the Development Process</h2>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Model your hunches about the processes that get work done.</li>\r\n<li>Use the models in peer interaction to communicate and refine thinking about how the process works.</li>\r\n<li>Use the models to simulate results.</li>\r\n<li>Tune the models against actual results.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h2>Pathological Politics</h2>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>You have to be willing to put your job on the line any day&hellip;</li>\r\n<li>&hellip; but that doesn&rsquo;t guarantee that pathological politics won&rsquo;t affect you.</li>\r\n<li>Pathological politics can crop up anywhere, even in the healthiest organisation.</li>\r\n<li>The defining characteristic of pathological politics is that  goals of personal power and influence come to override the natural goals of an organisation.</li>\r\n<li>This can happen even when the pathological goal is directly opposed to the organisational goal.</li>\r\n<li>Among the bad side effects of pathology: It becomes unsafe to have a leanly staffed project.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h2>Metrics</h2>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Size every single project.</li>\r\n<li>Don&rsquo;t sweat the units &ndash; while you are waiting to achieve objective metrification, use subjective units.</li>\r\n<li>Form synthetic metrics from all the primitives (countable characteristics of the software) available to you.</li>\r\n<li>Collect archived data to derive productivity trends from now-ended projects.</li>\r\n<li>Tinker with the formulation for your synthetic metric until its values give the best correlation to effort for set projects in your archived database.</li>\r\n<li>Draw a trend line through your database, showing expected effort as a function of values of the synthetic metric.</li>\r\n<li>For each new project to be estimated, compute value of the synthetic metric and use it to pick off expected effort from the trend line.</li>\r\n<li>Use the noise level around the productivity trend as an indicator of what tolerance to apply to the projections.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h2>Process and Process Improvement</h2>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Good process and continually improving process are admirable goals.</li>\r\n<li>There are also very natural goals: Good technical workers will focus on them whether you tell them to or not.</li>\r\n<li>Formal process improvement programmes cost time and money; a given process improvement effort may well set project work back. Evan if productivity gains materialise, they are unlikely to offset the time spent on process improvement for those projects that host the programme. A project can hope to gain enough from a single well-chosen method improvement to repay the time and money invested in the change.</li>\r\n<li>Projects cannot realistically hope to accommodate more that one method improvement over their duration.</li>\r\n<li>Multi-skill improvement programmes (e.g. increasing by an entire CMM level) are most likely to make projects finish later than they would have without the programme.</li>\r\n<li>The danger of standard process is that people will miss chances to take important shortcuts.</li>\r\n<li>Particularly on overstaffed projects, standard process will be observed rigorously as long as it generates sufficient work (useful or not) to keep everyone busy.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h2>Changing the Way Work Gets Done</h2>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>There is no way to get projects to perform substantially beyond the norm without making large reductions in the total amount of debugging time.</li>\r\n<li>High-performing projects spend proportionately far less of their time in debugging.</li>\r\n<li>High-performing projects spend proportionately far more of their time in design.</li>\r\n<li>You cannot get people to do anything different without caring for them and about them. To get them to change, you have to understand (appreciate) where they&rsquo;re coming from and why.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h2>The Effects of Pressure</h2>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>People under pressure do not think any faster.</li>\r\n<li>Extended overtime is a productivity reduction tactic.</li>\r\n<li>Short bursts of pressure and even overtime may be a useful tactic as they focus people and increase the sense that the work is important, but extended pressure is always a mistake.</li>\r\n<li>Perhaps managers make so much use of pressure because they do not know what else to do, or are daunted by how difficult the alternatives are.</li>\r\n<li>Terrible suspicion: The real reason for use of pressure and overtime may be to make everyone look better when the project fails.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h2>The Angry Manager</h2>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Anger and contempt in management are contagious. When upper management is abusive, lower management mimics the same behaviour (much like abused children who go on to become abusive parents).</li>\r\n<li>Managerial contempt is supposed to act as a goad to get people to invest more in their performance.  It is the most frequent &ldquo;stick&rdquo; of carrot-and-stick management. But where is the evidence that contempt has ever caused anyone to perform better?</li>\r\n<li>A manager&rsquo;s use of contempt to goad workers is more a sign of the manager&rsquo;s inadequacy than of the workers&rsquo;.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h2>Ambiguous Specification</h2>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Ambiguity in a specification is a sign of unresolved conflict among the various system stakeholders.</li>\r\n<li>A specification that doesn&rsquo;t contain a complete census of inputs and outputs is a nonstarter; it simply doesn&rsquo;t begin to specify.</li>\r\n<li>Nobody will tell you if a specification is lousy. People are inclined to blame themselves rather than it.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h2>Conflict</h2>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Whenever there are multiple parties to a development effort, there are bound to be conflicting interests.</li>\r\n<li>The business of building and installing systems is particularly conflict-prone.</li>\r\n<li>Most system development organisations have poor conflict-resolution skills.</li>\r\n<li>Conflict deserves respect. Conflict is not a sign of unprofessional behaviour.</li>\r\n<li>Declare up front that everybody&rsquo;s win conditions will be respected. Make sure that win conditions are elicited at all levels.</li>\r\n<li>Negotiation is hard; mediation is easy.</li>\r\n<li>Arrange up front that when win conditions are mutually exclusive of partly so, the parties will be expected to move into mediation to resolve conflict.</li>\r\n<li>Remember: We are both on the same side; it is the problem that&rsquo;s on the other side.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h2>Role of the Catalyst</h2>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>There is such a thing as a catalytic personality. Such people contribute to projects by helping teams to form and join together, and to remain healthy and productive. Even if team catalysts did nothing else (they usually do a lot else), their catalytic role is important and valuable.</li>\r\n<li>Mediation is a special case of the catalytic role. Mediation is learnable with a small investment.</li>\r\n<li>The small ceremony beginning, &ldquo;My I help by trying to mediate for you?&rdquo; can be an essential first step in conflict resolution.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h2>Human Error</h2>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>It&rsquo;s not what you don&rsquo;t know that kills you,&hellip; it&rsquo;s what you know that isn&rsquo;t so.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h2>Staff Level</h2>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Early overstaffing tends to force projects into shortcutting the key design activity (to give all those people something to do).</li>\r\n<li>When work is divided over a large staff prior to completion of design, the interfaces among people and among work groups are not minimised.</li>\r\n<li>This leads to increased interdependence, meeting time, rework, and frustration.</li>\r\n<li>Ideal staffing requires a small core team for most of the project, and then significant numbers of people added late in the process (as late as the last sixth of scheduled time).</li>\r\n<li>Awful suspicion: Projects that set out to achieve &lsquo;aggressive&rsquo; schedules probably take longer to complete than they would have if started with more reasonable schedules.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h2>Project Sociology</h2>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Keep meetings small by making it safe for unessential people not to attend. A published agenda, rigorously followed, is the easiest way to make nonattendance safe.</li>\r\n<li>Projects have need for ceremony.</li>\r\n<li>Use ceremony to focus attention on project goals and ideals: small meetings, zero-defect work, etc.</li>\r\n<li>Take steps to protect people from managers&rsquo; abusive anger.</li>\r\n<li>Remember: at work Anger = Fear. Managers who inflict abusive, angry behaviour on their subordinates are almost always doing it because they are afraid.</li>\r\n<li>Observation: If everybody understands that Anger = Fear, anger will be a transparent signal that the angry person is afraid; since there is an inclination not to reveal fear, he or she won&rsquo;t be able to vent the anger anymore. (This doesn&rsquo;t solve the angry person&rsquo;s problem, but it sure can make it easier on everyone else).</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h2>Pathological Politics (Again)</h2>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>You cannot expect to cure pathology from beneath.</li>\r\n<li>Don&rsquo;t waste your time or jeopardise your position by trying.</li>\r\n<li>Sometimes, your only option is to bide your time, waiting for the problem to resolve itself, or for a good opportunity for you to move on.</li>\r\n<li>Miracles may happen (but don&rsquo;t count on them).</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h2>Lean and Mean</h2>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Lean and Mean is a formula developed in failing companies by the people responsible for the failure.</li>\r\n<li>It is the opposite of any organisation&rsquo;s natural goal: to be prosperous and caring.</li>\r\n<li>Whenever you hear the phrase &ldquo;lean and mean&rdquo;, replace it with what it really connotes: failing and frightened.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h2>Radical Common Sense</h2>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>A project needs to have both goals and estimates.</li>\r\n<li>They should be different.</li>\r\n</ol>\";}'),

The monotonous reiteration of our actions results in losing the living tension when running a software product, so that we divert our attention, relax vigilance and lose keenness of perception. As a consequence product quality goes down.</p>\r\n<p>What is the means to combat it? The answer is to try a different approach. A more living and more creative one. For example, an exploratory approach.</p>\r\n<p>Where do we start? First thing you have to put yourself in the shoes of an end-user who is seeing the app for the first time.</p>\r\n<p>In order to do it with maximum efficiency you need to have clear answers to the following questions:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Who are the target users for the system? (accounting managers, marketing specialists, bank clerks, insurance agents, etc.)</li>\r\n<li>What are their everyday tasks? For what purpose do they use the product?</li>\r\n<li>What typical tasks does the app have to do for the given target group?</li>\r\n<li>How does the product communicate its functions to the user? How does it provide cues?</li>\r\n<li>Is the app user-friendly? Is it fail-safe and secure?</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Answering these questions will help in defining the scope of supposed tests. For example, when imagining yourself as an accounting manager, approach the task not as a software testing engineer who has to meet the specification but as an actual accountant preparing a quarterly or annual report, arranging for the payment, calculating the profit, and keeping accounts. Keep looking over the answers to the questions you defined for yourself when stating the purpose of the software product &ndash; this will help you stick to the point.</p>\r\n<p>In terms of this approach improvisation backed by experience and respective skills is likely to lead to amazing discoveries helping the app adapt to new risks.</p>\r\n<p>Ingenious exploratory testing can be considered one of the most important methods in software testing. However, its value is much underestimated and it is often discarded as loose and lacking a definite system.</p>\r\n<p>The progress continues supplementing the kit of existing tools and processes day by day. Yet tools and processes do not function by themselves &ndash; they require the power of human intellect. In other words, tools and processes merely help testing specialists in producing the needed result in terms of a quality testing process.</p>\r\n<p>Qulix QA testing specialists added a powerful thinking tool of exploratory testing to their wealth of knowledge long ago. In the course of testing we employ our creative potential 100% which has allowed us to devise certain methods of effective testing process management. You are hungry for quality software products? Then we are waiting for you!</p>\";}');
